Ethics in physiotherapy is the moral code of conduct that defines the conduct between the physiotherapist and his/her client or patient. Ethics provides the professional with a moral compass with which a professional is able to navigate between what is right and acceptable or what is wrong and unacceptable in his/her profession as a professional in practice. What constitute professional may sometimes vary from countries to countries. However, there are four basic cardinal principles in Ethics. They are: 
1. Beneficence (Do good)
2. Non-maleficence 
3. Autonomy(respect for patient)
